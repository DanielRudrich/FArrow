# FArrow

Simple macOS App which converts I, J, K, L keys to arrow keys when holding the F key.

I made this app because I wanted to use the arrow keys without moving my hands from the home row. I already use this functionality in my VIA configuration of my keyboards, however, when only using the laptop keyboard, I wanted to have the same functionality.
